![Hermes Feishu Streaming Card cover](docs/assets/readme-cover.png)

Hermes Feishu Streaming Card turns Hermes Agent Gateway replies in Feishu/Lark into one continuously updated interactive card. Reasoning, tool calls, final answers, approvals, choices, system notices, and runtime stats stay inside cards instead of spilling into scattered native gray text messages.

It targets the real pain points of running Hermes inside Feishu: missing or out-of-order streaming text, long tables/code blocks rendered as raw Markdown, invisible tool progress, manual approval replies, frozen topic timelines, multi-bot/profile troubleshooting, and uncertain hook compatibility after Hermes upgrades.

## V4 Live Agent States

| Running | Waiting for user |
|---|---|
| ![Real Feishu running state with the current tool action in the Header](docs/assets/feishu-v4-runtime-running.png) | ![Real Feishu waiting state with native buttons in the same card](docs/assets/feishu-v4-runtime-waiting.png) |
| Failed | Completed |
| ![Real Feishu failed state retaining the last tool preview](docs/assets/feishu-v4-runtime-failed.png) | ![Real Feishu completed state with only the native reply Header and final result](docs/assets/feishu-v4-runtime-completed.png) |

During execution, the Header follows real Hermes tool actions while public interim output continues streaming in the body. On completion, the native Feishu reply quote becomes the only Header instead of stacking a second `Hermes Agent` card title above it.

## What You Get

- **One continuously updated Feishu card**: `thinking.delta`, `answer.delta`, `tool.updated`, and `message.completed` merge into one card.
- **A live runtime Header**: the title keeps the user-configured card name (`Hermes Agent` by default), while the subtitle turns tool names and `tool.updated.detail` into concise action summaries; full commands remain in the timeline.
- **Primary answer and process timeline**: the final answer stays in the main content area while pre-tool answers, tool calls, and system notices move into the "Reasoning and Tools" timeline.
- **In-card interactions**: approval and clarify choices render as buttons; standalone commands such as `/new`, `/reset`, `/undo`, and `/model` use native interactive cards. V4 `/model` uses the same Provider/model list as Hermes CLI and follows a Provider → Model flow instead of crowding every model into one dropdown.
- **Consistent topic replies**: later topic stream events resolve by `reply_to_message_id` and keep updating the original card; system notices no longer spill out as duplicates.
- **Clearer group diagnostics**: `/hfc status` explains group chat binding state, the suggested bind command, and slash-command behavior boundaries.
- **Bounded operations cards**: `/hfc doctor` can present diagnosis, two-step safe repair, and restart confirmation; private chats do not compare operators, while group confirmations stay with the initiator. When operations cards are unavailable, use the CLI; normal streaming-card layout and footer are unchanged.
- **Long content protection**: long Markdown tables and fenced code blocks split on structure boundaries instead of raw character cuts.
- **Diagnostics and recovery**: `doctor`, `/hfc status`, `/health` metrics, runtime import checks, and safe repair/restore/uninstall cover common failures.

## Problems Solved

| Problem | What the plugin does |
|---|---|
| Feishu only shows a final wall of text | Streams reasoning, answer, tool status, and footer stats into one card |
| Hermes emits separate `Working`, compression, skill loading, or review messages | Classifies them as `system.notice` and routes them into the active card or a compact notice card |
| Topic replies show the first card but the timeline stops updating | Anchors topic events with `source.message_id` / `reply_to_message_id` |
| Approval, choices, and model switching require manual numbered replies | Uses Feishu buttons or dropdowns first, then falls back to text when cards are unavailable |
| Hermes upgrades make hook compatibility unclear | `doctor --explain` reports `version_source`, `hook_strategy`, `compatibility`, anchors, and recommendations |

## Quick Install

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileyh8/hermes-feishu-streaming-card/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileyh8/hermes-feishu-streaming-card/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer installs or upgrades the plugin, reads or prompts for Feishu credentials, writes a local `.env`, and runs the integrated setup command:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli setup \
  --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent \
  --config ~/.hermes/config.yaml \
  --yes
```

Check the sidecar after install:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli status --config ~/.hermes/config.yaml
```

For Release packages, Docker, PEP 668, uv, and installer details, see [README-install.md](README-install.md) and the [full user guide](docs/user-guide.en.md).

## Minimal Config

Copy `config.yaml.example` locally and never commit real credentials.

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8765
feishu:
  app_id: ""
  app_secret: ""
card:
  title: Hermes Agent
  footer_fields: [duration, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, context]
```

To show remaining Codex subscription quota, add `subscription_usage` to `footer_fields`. The plugin calls Hermes native `fetch_account_usage("openai-codex")` only when explicitly enabled; older Hermes versions, missing login, or network failures silently omit the field without affecting card completion.

Feishu credentials can also live in a `.env` next to the config:

```bash
FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxx
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxx
FEISHU_CONNECTION_MODE=websocket
FEISHU_HOME_CHANNEL=oc_xxx
```

Multi-bot routing, group chat bindings, multi-profile config, profile-aware routing, footer fields, and no-op client behavior are covered in the [full user guide](docs/user-guide.en.md#configuration).

## Hermes Streaming Config

Confirm `streaming.enabled` is `true`, and let Hermes use edit transport.

Make sure Hermes `config.yaml` enables streaming edits:

```yaml
streaming:
  enabled: true
  transport: edit
```

Do not set `display.platforms.feishu.streaming: false`. Do not treat `display.show_reasoning` as required for this plugin; it can append reasoning blocks to the final answer and disrupt the streaming card experience. The plugin consumes Hermes `thinking.delta` / `answer.delta` directly.

The compatibility matrix covers older Hermes starting at `v2026.4.23` and Hermes 0.13.0+/0.14.0/0.15.x/0.17.x/0.18.x. `doctor` prefers `VERSION` or a Git tag, and can fall back to verified `gateway/run.py` anchors when version metadata is missing or unparseable. After upgrading Hermes or this plugin, rerun `setup` or `install --hermes-dir ... --yes`.

## Docker Container Install

For an existing Hermes container:

```bash
export FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxx
export FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxx
export HFC_VERSION=v4.0.2
bash install-docker.sh
```

Defaults:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `HERMES_DIR` | `/opt/hermes` |
| `HFC_CONFIG` | `/opt/data/config.yaml` |
| `HFC_ENV_FILE` | `/opt/data/.env` |
| `HFC_VERSION` | `latest` |

`docker-compose.example.yml` is an integration example, not an official image. Since V3.8.6, Docker/source-stripped Hermes roots without `VERSION` or `.git` can fall back to Gateway anchors and still choose `gateway_run_013_plus`.

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setup --hermes-dir ... --yes` | Configure, diagnose, install hook, and start sidecar |
| `doctor --config ... --hermes-dir ... --explain` | Diagnose Hermes version, runtime import, hook strategy, anchors, and recommendations |
| `install --hermes-dir ... --yes` | Install the plugin into Hermes runtime venv and patch Hermes |
| `repair --hermes-dir ... --yes` | Repair verifiable hook manifest/backup state |
| `setup --repair ... --yes` / `--no-repair` | Automatically repair known-safe state, or explicitly opt out |
| `restore --hermes-dir ... --yes` | Restore the original Hermes file |
| `start --config ...` / `status --config ...` / `stop --config ...` | Manage the sidecar process and `/health` checks |
| `smoke-feishu-card --profile-id ... --chat-id ...` | Send a real Feishu card smoke test |
| `bots list|show|add|remove|test` | Manage and test multi-bot routing |

High-frequency stream tuning usually needs no change. For DeepSeek burst, token-by-token, or long-context pressure:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `HERMES_FEISHU_CARD_DELTA_COALESCE_MS` | `250` | Max Gateway-side delta coalescing wait |
| `HERMES_FEISHU_CARD_DELTA_COALESCE_CHARS` | `600` | Flush pending delta when this character budget is reached |
| `HERMES_FEISHU_CARD_DELTA_COALESCE_MAX_PENDING` | `128` | Pending delta session cap |

## Architecture At A Glance

```text
Hermes Gateway
  -> minimal hook in gateway/run.py
     -> hermes_feishu_card.hook_runtime
        -> HTTP POST /events
           -> sidecar server
              -> CardSession state
              -> Feishu CardKit send/update
              -> retry / coalescing / metrics / /health
```

This is a sidecar-only design: the Hermes hook stays fail-open, while Feishu delivery, card updates, session state, retries, and diagnostics live in the sidecar. Historical V2 code is archived under `legacy/` and is not the active runtime.
