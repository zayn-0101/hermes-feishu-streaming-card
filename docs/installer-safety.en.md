# Installer Safety

[中文](installer-safety.md) | [English](installer-safety.en.md)

The installer is designed to perform only minimal, verifiable, recoverable writes. Version text changes can fall back to `gateway/run.py` anchors, but uncertain code structure, backups, manifests, or file-safety checks still fail closed.

## Pre-install Checks

Before installation, the installer verifies:

- The Hermes directory exists and contains the expected `gateway/run.py`.
- Hermes version metadata is parseable, or `gateway/run.py` contains a structure recognized by the current hook. Supported inputs include `VERSION=v2026.4.23+`, Git tag `v2026.4.23+`, `0.18.x` semantic versions, descriptive version strings, and unparseable versions paired with verifiable anchors.
- `gateway/run.py` contains an insertion point recognized by the current hook.
- Existing install state, backup, and manifest are not contradictory.
- If the Hermes directory contains `venv/bin/python`, `.venv/bin/python`, or the Windows `Scripts/python.exe` equivalent, that runtime Python must be able to import `hermes_feishu_card.hook_runtime`; otherwise setup installs the current plugin release into that venv before patching Hermes.

If a check fails, Hermes files are not modified.

Run a read-only diagnostic first:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --explain
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --json
```

Diagnostic output includes Hermes support status, Hermes root, `gateway/run.py`, `run_py_exists`, `version_source`, `version`, `minimum_supported_version`, `hook_strategy`, `compatibility`, anchors, and `reason`. From V3.9.1, source-stripped Hermes roots that have valid anchors but no version metadata display `version: unknown (source-stripped metadata)` so an anchor strategy is not mistaken for an actual version. From V3.6.2, diagnostics also include `runtime_import`, which confirms whether the Python interpreter actually used by Hermes Gateway can import `hermes_feishu_card.hook_runtime`. `--explain` renders runtime import, streaming config, manifest/backup/run.py install state, and next-step recommendations as a human-readable summary. `--json` emits a machine-readable report with `schema_version`, top-level `status`, `runtime_import`, `install_state`, and `recommendations` for issue templates and automation. All `doctor` modes are read-only and do not write Hermes files.

## Repair

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli repair --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli setup --repair --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml --yes
```

`repair` only fixes install-state this project can verify. If backup is missing but the current `run.py` can safely remove this project's owned patch, it recreates the backup. If manifest is missing, malformed, or stale after backup recreation, it rebuilds the manifest. If a Hermes upgrade leaves `run.py` as an upstream file without this project's patch, old backup/manifest files are treated as stale install state and cleared so the hook can be installed again. V3.9.1 also recovers a narrowly defined marker-only state: the manifest patched hash must equal the expected patch rebuilt from the verified backup, and the current file may differ from that expected patch only on this project's owned BEGIN/END marker lines. Non-marker edits, unknown markers, hash mismatches, and symlinks still fail closed.

## Backup And Manifest

Installation saves a backup of `gateway/run.py` before writing the patched file, then writes a manifest. The manifest records at least:

- Relative `run_py` path.
- Hash of the patched `run.py`.
- Relative backup path.
- Backup hash.

`restore` and `uninstall` use the manifest to verify the current `run.py` and backup are in a state owned by this installer. If user changes or unknown tool changes are detected, the command refuses to overwrite.

## Atomic Writes

The installer writes `run.py`, backup files, and manifest files via temporary file replacement to avoid truncated files. If any install step fails, already-written state should be rolled back or cleaned up.

## Restore And Uninstall

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli uninstall --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

`restore` restores the Hermes file that existed before installation. `uninstall` removes the hook and install state owned by this plugin. Neither command should overwrite unverifiable user changes.

When migrating from legacy/dual historical installs, read [migration.en.md](migration.en.md). Historical `legacy/installer_v2.py`, `legacy/gateway_run_patch.py`, and `legacy/patch_feishu.py` wrote patches outside the current manifest model and must not be assumed recoverable by current `restore`.

## Degraded Behavior

If the sidecar is unavailable, times out, or returns an error, the Hermes hook lets Hermes continue with native text replies. Card failure is a plugin failure, not an Agent workflow failure.

Hook import or emit exceptions also remain fail-open, but should not be fully silent. From V3.6.2, injected hook blocks write `[hermes-feishu-card] hook failed: ...` to Hermes stderr so runtime venv, import, or sidecar emit problems are diagnosable from Gateway logs.
