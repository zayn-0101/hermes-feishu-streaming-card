# Migrating From legacy/dual To sidecar-only

[中文](migration.md) | [English](migration.en.md)

This document covers safe migration from historical legacy/dual/patch implementations in this repository to the current `hermes_feishu_card/` sidecar-only mainline. Historical entry points are archived under `legacy/`, including `legacy/adapter/`, old `legacy/sidecar/`, old `legacy/patch/`, `legacy/installer.py`, `legacy/installer_sidecar.py`, `legacy/installer_v2.py`, `legacy/gateway_run_patch.py`, and `legacy/patch_feishu.py`. They are not the active runtime.

## Principles

- Back up first, then diagnose, then install. Any uncertain state should fail closed.
- Do not mix legacy/dual hooks with the sidecar-only hook.
- Do not commit App Secret, tenant token, real chat_id, logs, or screenshots containing private content.
- Do not manually copy old patch fragments into Hermes `gateway/run.py`.
- If Hermes files were changed by users or other tools, inspect the diff before continuing.

## Recommended Flow

1. Stop the current sidecar-only process if it has been started:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config config.yaml.example
```

2. Keep an external backup of the Hermes installation directory. Back up the whole Hermes directory, not just this repository.

3. If the current Hermes directory was installed by this sidecar-only plugin, restore first:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

`restore` only handles install state that the current manifest can verify. If it reports `run.py changed since install`, `backup changed since install`, or `install state incomplete`, stop and inspect Hermes `gateway/run.py` manually.

4. If Hermes previously used historical legacy/dual scripts such as `legacy/installer_v2.py`, `legacy/gateway_run_patch.py`, or `legacy/patch_feishu.py`, restore from the original backup created by those scripts. If no trusted backup exists, reinstall or check out the matching Hermes version before migration.

5. Run read-only diagnostics:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
```

Continue only when the output says `hermes: supported` and `version`, `version_source`, `run_py_exists`, and `reason` match expectations.

6. Install the sidecar-only hook:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

The installer creates a backup and manifest, then installs a minimal hook that calls `hermes_feishu_card.hook_runtime`. Feishu CardKit, session state, health metrics, and retry counts live inside the sidecar process.

7. Start and inspect the sidecar:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config config.yaml.example
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli status --config config.yaml.example
```

`status` should show `status: running`, `active_sessions`, and metrics. Without Feishu credentials, advanced starts use a no-op client. With credentials, the sidecar reads them only from local config or environment variables.

## Upgrading To V3.4.0

V3.4.0+ selects the hook strategy from the Hermes version and `gateway/run.py` code anchors. Hermes `0.13.0+`, `0.14.0` / `v2026.5.16+` uses `gateway_run_013_plus`; older Hermes from `v2026.4.23` through `v2026.4.x` continues to use `legacy_gateway_run`. After upgrading the plugin, reinstall the hook; restarting the sidecar alone is not enough.

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
pip install -e ".[test]" --upgrade
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
```

`doctor` output should include `hook_strategy`, `compatibility`, and anchors. If Hermes has been upgraded to `0.13.0+`, `0.14.0`, or `v2026.5.16+`, confirm `hook_strategy: gateway_run_013_plus` before installing; older `v2026.4.x` Hermes should continue to report `legacy_gateway_run`.

For multiple independent Hermes profile processes, set a stable `HERMES_FEISHU_CARD_PROFILE_ID` for each process. This avoids ambiguous automatic profile detection and keeps profile-to-bot routing explicit. A single sidecar serving multiple profiles should still use the `profiles` section for each profile's credentials, bots, and card title.

## Upgrading From V3.1 To V3.2.1

V3.2.1 is **backward compatible** with V3.1 on the sidecar-only architecture. Single-bot configurations continue to work without changes; to use the new multi-bot / group chat binding features, the configuration must be extended.

### Upgrade Steps

1. **Back up current config**

   ```bash
   cp ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml.v3.1.backup
   ```

2. **Stop the sidecar (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```

3. **Update code to V3.2.1**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hermes-feishu-streaming-card
   git checkout v3.2.1  # or the latest tag
   python3 -m pip install -e ".[test]" --upgrade
   ```

4. **Update configuration**

   Option A: Use CLI to generate an updated template (preserves existing config, adds V3.2.1 fields)
   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli setup --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml --yes
   ```
   This supplements the existing `config.yaml` with new top-level fields (`bots`, `bindings`, etc.) without overwriting existing values.

   Option B: Manual merge (see `config.yaml.example` for a complete sample)
   - Add a `bots:` list under `hermes:` (at least one bot; its `app_id`/`app_secret` can be inherited from the original single-bot fields)
   - Add a `bindings:` section with `fallback_bot` and optional `chats:` mappings
   - The old `feishu.app_id` / `feishu.app_secret` are still valid in single-bot mode, but migrating to `bots[0]` is recommended for consistency

5. **Validate configuration**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```
   Expect `config: valid` and correct detection of `bots` / `bindings` fields.

6. **Restart sidecar**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli status --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```

7. **Functional validation**
   - Send a card message in a 1-to-1 or group chat to confirm normal rendering
   - If multi-bot is configured, check `/health.routing` for routing stats
   - Run `cli bots list` to verify the bot registry

### Compatibility Notes

- V3.1 single-bot configs **continue to work** on V3.2.1 without modification (old fields still supported)
- V3.2.1's multi-bot features are optional; if `bindings.chats` is unset, all conversations route to `bindings.fallback_bot`
- Environment variables `FEISHU_APP_ID` / `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` remain effective in V3.2.1, but `config.yaml`'s `bots[]` takes precedence
- To roll back to V3.1: stop the sidecar, restore the backed-up `config.yaml`, and reinstall the V3.1 version

### Important Notes

- Each bot used in multi-bot mode must be created in the Feishu Open Platform with `send_message` and `update_message` permissions
- Group chat bindings require `chat_id` (obtained from the Feishu client or API), not the group name
- After upgrading, it is recommended to run `pytest -q` locally to ensure all tests pass

## Rollback

To roll back:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config config.yaml.example
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

If `restore` refuses to overwrite, do not force-delete the hook. Compare Hermes `gateway/run.py`, the installer backup, the manifest, and any external backup before manual recovery.

## Verification Checklist

- `doctor --config ... --hermes-dir ...` prints `hermes: supported`.
- `install --hermes-dir ... --yes` prints `install ok`.
- `start --config ...` prints `start ok` or `start: already running`.
- `status --config ...` prints `/health` metrics.
- Hermes native text still works when the sidecar is unavailable.
- `gateway/run.py` does not contain both legacy/dual and sidecar-only hooks.
